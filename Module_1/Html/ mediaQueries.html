    <h1>Media Queries</h1>
    <p>Media Queries in CSS are used to apply styles conditionally, based on the characteristics of the device or browser (like screen size, resolution, orientation, etc.). They help in creating responsive web designs by adjusting the layout and styles to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) and environments.</p>
