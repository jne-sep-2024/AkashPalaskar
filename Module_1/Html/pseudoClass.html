        pseudo-class is a keyword that is added to a selector to target an element when it is in a specific state or condition. They are commonly used for things like hover effects, styling the first or last child of a parent, or when an element is focused.</p>
    <p>pseudo-element is used to style a specific part of an element, like the first letter, first line, or inserting content before or after the element. Pseudo-elements allow you to style these parts of an element separately from the rest of the content.</p>
